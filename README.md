# Pitch Class Set Calculator

A pitch class set calculator. Includes

- Normal form generator
- Prime form generator
- Transposer
- Inverter
- Set comparison


# Comparing Sets

To compare sets, use the pitch clock to enter the first set. Then enter the set (in any order) in the compare boxes and press the compare key. The result will be posted in the result box with "T" for transposed and "I" for inverted along with the transposition or inversion index. 

# Known issues

Some sets with no largest interval do not produce the correct normal or prime forms. This typically only happens with inversionally symettrical sets containing 5 or more pitches. This can also result in incorrect comparisons, though transposing and inverting the set will still work correctly.
